<p>The following configuration enables the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Cluster</span></code> extension to be used.
It joins the cluster and an actor subscribes to cluster membership events and logs them.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">application.conf</span></code> configuration looks like this:</p>
<p>To enable cluster capabilities in your Akka project you should, at a minimum, add the <a class="reference internal" href="remoting.html#remoting-java"><span class="std std-ref">Remoting</span></a>
settings, but with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cluster</span></code>.
The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">akka.cluster.seed-nodes</span></code> should normally also be added to your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">application.conf</span></code> file.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">注釈</p>
<p class="last">If you are running Akka in a Docker container or the nodes for some other reason have separate internal and
external ip addresses you must configure remoting according to <a class="reference internal" href="remoting.html#remote-configuration-nat-java"><span class="std std-ref">Akka behind NAT or in a Docker container</span></a></p>
</div>
<p>The seed nodes are configured contact points for initial, automatic, join of the cluster.</p>
<p>Note that if you are going to start the nodes on different machines you need to specify the
ip-addresses or host names of the machines in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">application.conf</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">127.0.0.1</span></code></p>
<p>An actor that uses the cluster extension may look like this:</p>
<p>The actor registers itself as subscriber of certain cluster events. It receives events corresponding to the current state
of the cluster when the subscription starts and then it receives events for changes that happen in the cluster.</p>
<p>The easiest way to run this example yourself is to download <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lightbend.com/platform/getstarted">Lightbend Activator</a>
and open the tutorial named <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lightbend.com/activator/template/akka-sample-cluster-java">Akka Cluster Samples with Java</a>.
It contains instructions of how to run the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SimpleClusterApp</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="joining-to-seed-nodes">
<h2>Joining to Seed Nodes</h2>
<p>You may decide if joining to the cluster should be done manually or automatically
to configured initial contact points, so-called seed nodes. When a new node is started
it sends a message to all seed nodes and then sends join command to the one that
answers first. If no one of the seed nodes replied (might not be started yet)
it retries this procedure until successful or shutdown.</p>
<p>You define the seed nodes in the <a class="reference internal" href="#cluster-configuration-java"><span class="std std-ref">Configuration</span></a> file (application.conf):</p>
<div class="highlight-scala"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>akka.cluster.seed-nodes = [
  &quot;akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@host1:2552&quot;,
  &quot;akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@host2:2552&quot;]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This can also be defined as Java system properties when starting the JVM using the following syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>-Dakka.cluster.seed-nodes.0=akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@host1:2552
-Dakka.cluster.seed-nodes.1=akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@host2:2552
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The seed nodes can be started in any order and it is not necessary to have all
seed nodes running, but the node configured as the first element in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed-nodes</span></code>
configuration list must be started when initially starting a cluster, otherwise the
other seed-nodes will not become initialized and no other node can join the cluster.
The reason for the special first seed node is to avoid forming separated islands when
starting from an empty cluster.
It is quickest to start all configured seed nodes at the same time (order doesn't matter),
otherwise it can take up to the configured <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed-node-timeout</span></code> until the nodes
can join.</p>
<p>Once more than two seed nodes have been started it is no problem to shut down the first
seed node. If the first seed node is restarted, it will first try to join the other
seed nodes in the existing cluster.</p>
<p>If you don't configure seed nodes you need to join the cluster programmatically or manually.</p>
<p>Manual joining can be performed by using ref:<cite>cluster_jmx_java</cite> or <a class="reference internal" href="#cluster-command-line-java"><span class="std std-ref">Command Line Management</span></a>.
Joining programmatically can be performed with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Cluster.get(system).join</span></code>. Unsuccessful join attempts are
automatically retried after the time period defined in configuration property <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">retry-unsuccessful-join-after</span></code>.
Retries can be disabled by setting the property to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">off</span></code>.</p>
<p>You can join to any node in the cluster. It does not have to be configured as a seed node.
Note that you can only join to an existing cluster member, which means that for bootstrapping some
node must join itself,and then the following nodes could join them to make up a cluster.</p>
<p>You may also use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Cluster.get(system).joinSeedNodes</span></code> to join programmatically,
which is attractive when dynamically discovering other nodes at startup by using some external tool or API.
When using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">joinSeedNodes</span></code> you should not include the node itself except for the node that is
supposed to be the first seed node, and that should be placed first in parameter to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">joinSeedNodes</span></code>.</p>
<p>Unsuccessful attempts to contact seed nodes are automatically retried after the time period defined in
configuration property <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed-node-timeout</span></code>. Unsuccessful attempt to join a specific seed node is
automatically retried after the configured <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">retry-unsuccessful-join-after</span></code>. Retrying means that it
tries to contact all seed nodes and then joins the node that answers first. The first node in the list
of seed nodes will join itself if it cannot contact any of the other seed nodes within the
configured <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed-node-timeout</span></code>.</p>
<p>An actor system can only join a cluster once. Additional attempts will be ignored.
When it has successfully joined it must be restarted to be able to join another
cluster or to join the same cluster again. It can use the same host name and port
after the restart, when it come up as new incarnation of existing member in the cluster,
trying to join in, then the existing one will be removed from the cluster and then it will
be allowed to join.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">注釈</p>
<p class="last">The name of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ActorSystem</span></code> must be the same for all members of a cluster. The name is given

<div class="section" id="downing">
<span id="automatic-vs-manual-downing-java"></span><h2>Downing</h2>
<p>When a member is considered by the failure detector to be unreachable the
leader is not allowed to perform its duties, such as changing status of
new joining members to 'Up'. The node must first become reachable again, or the
status of the unreachable member must be changed to 'Down'. Changing status to 'Down'
can be performed automatically or manually. By default it must be done manually, using
<a class="reference internal" href="#cluster-jmx-java"><span class="std std-ref">JMX</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="#cluster-command-line-java"><span class="std std-ref">Command Line Management</span></a>.</p>
<p>It can also be performed programmatically with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Cluster.get(system).down(address)</span></code>.</p>
<p>A pre-packaged solution for the downing problem is provided by
<a class="reference external" href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/akka-commercial-addons-1.0/java/split-brain-resolver.html">Split Brain Resolver</a>,
which is part of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lightbend.com/platform">Lightbend Reactive Platform</a>.

of the Split Brain Resolver and make sure that the solution you are using handles the concerns
described there.</p>
<div class="section" id="auto-downing-do-not-use">
<h3>Auto-downing (DO NOT USE)</h3>
<p>There is an atomatic downing feature that you should not use in production. For testing purpose you can enable it with configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">akka</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cluster</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">auto</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">down</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">unreachable</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">after</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="mi">120</span><span class="n">s</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This means that the cluster leader member will change the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></code> node
status to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></code> automatically after the configured time of unreachability.</p>
<p>This is a naïve approach to remove unreachable nodes from the cluster membership. It
works great for crashes and short transient network partitions, but not for long network
partitions. Both sides of the network partition will see the other side as unreachable
and after a while remove it from its cluster membership. Since this happens on both
sides the result is that two separate disconnected clusters have been created. This
can also happen because of long GC pauses or system overload.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">警告</p>
<p class="last">We recommend against using the auto-down feature of Akka Cluster in production.
This is crucial for correct behavior if you use <a class="reference internal" href="cluster-singleton.html#cluster-singleton-java"><span class="std std-ref">Cluster Singleton</span></a> or
<a class="reference internal" href="cluster-sharding.html#cluster-sharding-java"><span class="std std-ref">Cluster Sharding</span></a>, especially together with Akka <a class="reference internal" href="persistence.html#persistence-java"><span class="std std-ref">Persistence</span></a>.
For Akka Persistence with Cluster Sharding it can result in corrupt data in case
of network partitions.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leaving">
<h2>Leaving</h2>
<p>There are two ways to remove a member from the cluster.</p>
<p>You can just stop the actor system (or the JVM process). It will be detected
as unreachable and removed after the automatic or manual downing as described
above.</p>
<p>A more graceful exit can be performed if you tell the cluster that a node shall leave.
This can be performed using <a class="reference internal" href="#cluster-jmx-java"><span class="std std-ref">JMX</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="#cluster-command-line-java"><span class="std std-ref">Command Line Management</span></a>.
It can also be performed programmatically with:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">final</span> <span class="nc">Cluster</span> <span class="n">cluster</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="nc">Cluster</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">system</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">cluster</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">leave</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">cluster</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">selfAddress</span><span class="o">());</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that this command can be issued to any member in the cluster, not necessarily the
one that is leaving. The cluster extension, but not the actor system or JVM, of the
leaving member will be shutdown after the leader has changed status of the member to
<cite>Exiting</cite>. Thereafter the member will be removed from the cluster. Normally this is handled
automatically, but in case of network failures during this process it might still be necessary
to set the node’s status to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Down</span></code> in order to complete the removal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="weaklyup-members">
<span id="weakly-up-java"></span><h2>WeaklyUp Members</h2>
<p>If a node is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></code> then gossip convergence is not possible and therefore any
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></code> actions are also not possible. However, we still might want new nodes to join
the cluster in this scenario.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">警告</p>
<p class="last">The WeaklyUp feature is marked as <strong>“experimental”</strong> as of its introduction in Akka 2.4.0. We will continue to
improve this feature based on our users’ feedback, which implies that while we try to keep incompatible
changes to a minimum the binary compatibility guarantee for maintenance releases does not apply this feature.</p>
</div>
<p>This feature is disabled by default. With a configuration option you can allow this behavior:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">akka</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cluster</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">allow</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">weakly</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">up</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">members</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">on</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">allow-weakly-up-members</span></code> is enabled and there is no gossip convergence,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Joining</span></code> members will be promoted to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WeaklyUp</span></code> and they will become part of the
cluster. Once gossip convergence is reached, the leader will move <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WeaklyUp</span></code>
members to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Up</span></code>.</p>
<p>You can subscribe to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WeaklyUp</span></code> membership event to make use of the members that are
in this state, but you should be aware of that members on the other side of a network partition
have no knowledge about the existence of the new members. You should for example not count
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WeaklyUp</span></code> members in quorum decisions.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">警告</p>
<p class="last">This feature is only available from Akka 2.4.0 and cannot be used if some of your
cluster members are running an older version of Akka.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subscribe-to-cluster-events">
<span id="cluster-subscriber-java"></span><h2>Subscribe to Cluster Events</h2>
<p>You can subscribe to change notifications of the cluster membership by using
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Cluster.get(system).subscribe</span></code>.</p>
<p>A snapshot of the full state, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">akka.cluster.ClusterEvent.CurrentClusterState</span></code>, is sent to the subscriber
as the first message, followed by events for incremental updates.</p>
<p>Note that you may receive an empty <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CurrentClusterState</span></code>, containing no members,
if you start the subscription before the initial join procedure has completed.
This is expected behavior. When the node has been accepted in the cluster you will
receive <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MemberUp</span></code> for that node, and other nodes.</p>
<p>If you find it inconvenient to handle the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CurrentClusterState</span></code> you can use
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ClusterEvent.initialStateAsEvents()</span></code> as parameter to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">subscribe</span></code>.
That means that instead of receiving <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CurrentClusterState</span></code> as the first message you will receive
the events corresponding to the current state to mimic what you would have seen if you were
listening to the events when they occurred in the past. Note that those initial events only correspond
to the current state and it is not the full history of all changes that actually has occurred in the cluster.</p>
<p>The events to track the life-cycle of members are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ClusterEvent.MemberJoined</span></code> - A new member has joined the cluster and its status has been changed to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Joining</span></code>.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ClusterEvent.MemberUp</span></code> - A new member has joined the cluster and its status has been changed to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Up</span></code>.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ClusterEvent.MemberExited</span></code> - A member is leaving the cluster and its status has been changed to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Exiting</span></code>
Note that the node might already have been shutdown when this event is published on another node.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ClusterEvent.MemberRemoved</span></code> - Member completely removed from the cluster.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ClusterEvent.UnreachableMember</span></code> - A member is considered as unreachable, detected by the failure detector
of at least one other node.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ClusterEvent.ReachableMember</span></code> - A member is considered as reachable again, after having been unreachable.
All nodes that previously detected it as unreachable has detected it as reachable again.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more types of change events, consult the API documentation
of classes that extends <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">akka.cluster.ClusterEvent.ClusterDomainEvent</span></code>
for details about the events.</p>
<p>Instead of subscribing to cluster events it can sometimes be convenient to only get the full membership state with
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Cluster.get(system).state()</span></code>. Note that this state is not necessarily in sync with the events published to a
cluster subscription.</p>
<div class="section" id="worker-dial-in-example">
<h3>Worker Dial-in Example</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at an example that illustrates how workers, here named <em>backend</em>,
can detect and register to new master nodes, here named <em>frontend</em>.</p>
<p>The example application provides a service to transform text. When some text
is sent to one of the frontend services, it will be delegated to one of the
backend workers, which performs the transformation job, and sends the result back to
the original client. New backend nodes, as well as new frontend nodes, can be
added or removed to the cluster dynamically.</p>
<p>Messages:</p>
<p>The backend worker that performs the transformation job:</p>
<p>Note that the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">TransformationBackend</span></code> actor subscribes to cluster events to detect new,

<h2>Node Roles</h2>
<p>Not all nodes of a cluster need to perform the same function: there might be one sub-set which runs the web front-end,
one which runs the data access layer and one for the number-crunching. Deployment of actors—for example by cluster-aware
routers—can take node roles into account to achieve this distribution of responsibilities.</p>
<p>The roles of a node is defined in the configuration property named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">akka.cluster.roles</span></code>
and it is typically defined in the start script as a system property or environment variable.</p>
<p>The roles of the nodes is part of the membership information in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MemberEvent</span></code> that you can subscribe to.</p>

<h2>How To Startup when Cluster Size Reached</h2>
<p>A common use case is to start actors after the cluster has been initialized,

<p>With a configuration option you can define required number of members
before the leader changes member status of 'Joining' members to 'Up'.</p>
<p>In a similar way you can define required number of members of a certain role
before the leader changes member status of 'Joining' members to 'Up'.</p>
<p>You can start the actors in a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">registerOnMemberUp</span></code> callback, which will
be invoked when the current member status is changed to 'Up', i.e. the cluster
has at least the defined number of members.</p>

<div class="section" id="failure-detector">
<h2>Failure Detector</h2>
<p>In a cluster each node is monitored by a few (default maximum 5) other nodes, and when
any of these detects the node as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></code> that information will spread to
the rest of the cluster through the gossip. In other words, only one node needs to
mark a node <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></code> to have the rest of the cluster mark that node <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></code>.</p>
<p>The failure detector will also detect if the node becomes <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reachable</span></code> again. When
all nodes that monitored the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></code> node detects it as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reachable</span></code> again
the cluster, after gossip dissemination, will consider it as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reachable</span></code>.</p>
<p>If system messages cannot be delivered to a node it will be quarantined and then it
cannot come back from <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></code>. This can happen if the there are too many
unacknowledged system messages (e.g. watch, Terminated, remote actor deployment,
failures of actors supervised by remote parent). Then the node needs to be moved
to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">removed</span></code> states and the actor system of the quarantined node
must be restarted before it can join the cluster again.</p>
<p>The nodes in the cluster monitor each other by sending heartbeats to detect if a node is
unreachable from the rest of the cluster. The heartbeat arrival times is interpreted
by an implementation of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~defago/files/pdf/IS_RR_2004_010.pdf">The Phi Accrual Failure Detector</a>.</p>
<p>The suspicion level of failure is given by a value called <em>phi</em>.
The basic idea of the phi failure detector is to express the value of <em>phi</em> on a scale that
is dynamically adjusted to reflect current network conditions.</p>
<p>The value of <em>phi</em> is calculated as:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">phi</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">log10</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">timeSinceLastHeartbeat</span><span class="o">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where F is the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution with mean
and standard deviation estimated from historical heartbeat inter-arrival times.</p>
<p>In the <a class="reference internal" href="#cluster-configuration-java"><span class="std std-ref">Configuration</span></a> you can adjust the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">akka.cluster.failure-detector.threshold</span></code>
to define when a <em>phi</em> value is considered to be a failure.</p>
<p>A low <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">threshold</span></code> is prone to generate many false positives but ensures
a quick detection in the event of a real crash. Conversely, a high <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">threshold</span></code>
generates fewer mistakes but needs more time to detect actual crashes. The
default <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">threshold</span></code> is 8 and is appropriate for most situations. However in
cloud environments, such as Amazon EC2, the value could be increased to 12 in
order to account for network issues that sometimes occur on such platforms.</p>
<p>The following chart illustrates how <em>phi</em> increase with increasing time since the
previous heartbeat.</p>
<img alt="../_images/phi1.png" src="../_images/phi1.png" />
<p>Phi is calculated from the mean and standard deviation of historical
inter arrival times. The previous chart is an example for standard deviation
of 200 ms. If the heartbeats arrive with less deviation the curve becomes steeper,
i.e. it is possible to determine failure more quickly. The curve looks like this for
a standard deviation of 100 ms.</p>
<img alt="../_images/phi2.png" src="../_images/phi2.png" />
<p>To be able to survive sudden abnormalities, such as garbage collection pauses and
transient network failures the failure detector is configured with a margin,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">akka.cluster.failure-detector.acceptable-heartbeat-pause</span></code>. You may want to
adjust the <a class="reference internal" href="#cluster-configuration-java"><span class="std std-ref">Configuration</span></a> of this depending on you environment.
This is how the curve looks like for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">acceptable-heartbeat-pause</span></code> configured to
3 seconds.</p>
<img alt="../_images/phi3.png" src="../_images/phi3.png" />
<p>Death watch uses the cluster failure detector for nodes in the cluster, i.e. it detects
network failures and JVM crashes, in addition to graceful termination of watched
actor. Death watch generates the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Terminated</span></code> message to the watching actor when the
unreachable cluster node has been downed and removed.</p>
<p>If you encounter suspicious false positives when the system is under load you should
define a separate dispatcher for the cluster actors as described in <a class="reference internal" href="#cluster-dispatcher-java"><span class="std std-ref">Cluster Dispatcher</span></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="cluster-aware-routers">
<h2>Cluster Aware Routers</h2>
<p>All <a class="reference internal" href="routing.html#routing-java"><span class="std std-ref">routers</span></a> can be made aware of member nodes in the cluster, i.e.
deploying new routees or looking up routees on nodes in the cluster.
When a node becomes unreachable or leaves the cluster the routees of that node are
automatically unregistered from the router. When new nodes join the cluster additional
routees are added to the router, according to the configuration. Routees are also added
when a node becomes reachable again, after having been unreachable.</p>
<p>Cluster aware routers make use of members with status <a class="reference internal" href="#weakly-up-java"><span class="std std-ref">WeaklyUp</span></a> if that feature
is enabled.</p>
<p>There are two distinct types of routers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Group - router that sends messages to the specified path using actor selection</strong>
The routees can be shared between routers running on different nodes in the cluster.
One example of a use case for this type of router is a service running on some backend
nodes in the cluster and used by routers running on front-end nodes in the cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Pool - router that creates routees as child actors and deploys them on remote nodes.</strong>
Each router will have its own routee instances. For example, if you start a router
on 3 nodes in a 10 nodes cluster you will have 30 routee actors in total if the router is
configured to use one instance per node. The routees created by the different routers
will not be shared between the routers. One example of a use case for this type of router
is a single master that coordinate jobs and delegates the actual work to routees running
on other nodes in the cluster.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="router-with-group-of-routees">
<h3>Router with Group of Routees</h3>
<p>When using a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Group</span></code> you must start the routee actors on the cluster member nodes.

When some text is sent to the service it splits it into words, and delegates the task

the average number of characters per word when all results have been collected.</p>
